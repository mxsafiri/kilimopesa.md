## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Based in Dar es salaam Tanzania our platform has a network of 78 farmers based in the East African region. We are creating finacial and capital investement tools that will help farmers get up to 90% profit back from their farms. 

Our project achieves this by introducing a new supply chain management module that effectively lowers costs of production and have faster and rich production cycles. Our supply chain management incorporates several success factors, main ones include clear procurement strategies, effective control systems and development of expertise. 

### Overview

We are Giving farmers tools and capital investments to help them create a regenerating eco-system while solving systemic problems and regenerating community wealth and natural environments. Our goal is to heal and create shared value. Profits are not the end, but rather a means to further progress. In our regenerative finance module, circulation replaces accumulation
 
We want to use the NEAR Eco system to build smart contracts that will allow us to turn the equity we have under our DAO’s into tokens, NFT’s and even layer 1 stable currencies to be used as warranty to our investors based and backed by the returns from the agricultural economical activities the DAOs we operate yiled . 

KILIMO KWANZA is an operating registered business that will build and maintain these DAOs. We will secure the liquidity and tokenization of the equity our DAOs hold. Our team aims at revolutionizing the financial and socio-infrastructure for African communities. We are developing platforms that integrate digital process with every day applications into the web3 space. Creating sustainable way of trapping capital circulation in our communities.

We want to create a holistic approach, accounting for interlocking causes and effects. As we deploy capital more equitably to under-represented communites, while eliminating repayment terms and collateral requirements that extract resources from our communities — revising exclusionary credit standards, involving core stakeholders in decision-making and centralized systems. 

### Project Details
KILIMO PESA wants to use a multi-agent system smart contracts. These type of smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, allowing the circular economy market to thrive. Blockchain technology has an immense potential of re-defining our way of life, its imperative we introduce it right. We have a plan in action that we believe if executed right  could ripple mass effect.

Leveraging Blockchain technology KILIMO PESA is disrupting the agriculture field by improving the supply chain and ensuring the integrity, security, and traceability of data. It has the potential to improve farmers economic situation eliminating intermediaries and improving producer and customer satisfaction. ![7358354 fig 007](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113509902/193074012-4af5e3c2-ecad-4d85-a87e-3a6ec8fe2ccb.png)

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project is everything that NEAR stands for. eliminating the middleman. We want to build and grow in this space. Mintbase will allow us to grow and actualize our potential. Our methodology is automated; it can be used to optimize any supply chain, resulting in increased security and efficiency. 
We want to create a robust security characteristics to the agriculture system. I dont know anyother project similar to ours in the region. We would love to know and learn from any Re-fi agri blockchain networks on NEAR
